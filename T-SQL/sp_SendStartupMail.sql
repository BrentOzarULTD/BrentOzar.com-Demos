/* sp_SendStartupMail - get alerted when your SQL Server starts up.

Documentation: https://www.brentozar.com/go/startupmail

To set this up, you need to:

1. Enable startup stored procs

2. Configure database mail: at least one profile and one operator

3. If you have multiple profiles and/or operators, configure the table that
  sp_SendStartupMail uses to pick which profile & operator to use

4. Create sp_SendStartupMail and mark it as a startup stored procedure 

And the below script will help. Let's get started.
